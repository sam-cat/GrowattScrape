# GrowattScrape
Scrape data from the Growatt Solar PV portal - Needs your login details filling out in the code (use a browser account so its read only)

Works as their new site does not require a captcha, much better

This just outputs the current power (for a home display project I am working on), but tons of other info is available if you dig into the API's using your browser.
